- [Responsive with JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IwUl-4pAzc&list=PLvq-jIkSeTUZ6QgYYO3MwG9EMqC-KoLXA&index=91) - The most difficult part of the challenge was trying to implement img srcset to change the img-divider. Since that did not go well, I used instead this function to change the HTML content with JavaScript. It's a very useful function that I've used on multiple projects. Note: the video is in Spanish.
